Patch layout:
=============

"make patch" does 2 things:

  1. copy Untangle C patches from patches/untangle to
     linux-4.9.30/debian/patches/series-untangle; they will only be
     applied once the kernel is about to be built

  2. apply Untangle patches to the debian/ kernel build system, from
     patches/debian, directly over linux-4.9.30/debian

Note that at this point the Debian upstream patches are not applied
(see "Development" section below for that).

Dependencies:
=============

To make sure you have everything necessary:

  make deps

Debian packages:
================

To build arch-indep packages (headers, doc, src, etc):

  make kpkg-indep

To build arch-dep packages (actual kernel, modules):

  make kpkg-arch

To build both sets:

  make pkgs

Development:
============

To get a full tree, with all patches (Debian & Untangle) *applied*,
run the following once:

  make kpkg-arch

The tree then lives in (on an amd64 machine):

  linux-4.9.30/debian/build/build_amd64_untangle_amd64

From there, the best approach is to transplant this somewhere else,
and then set that up as a git tree so you can track and later export
your changes:

  cp -R linux-4.9.30/debian/build/build_amd64_untangle_amd64 /tmp/debian-4.9.30
  cd /tmp/debian-4.9.30
  git init
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Initial commit"

You can then edit, commit, build (using "make bzImage && make
modules"), and iterate until ready, before moving to the "Exporting
patches" section below.

Exporting patches back to the official tree:
============================================

At this point, a git diff between the initial commit (corresponding to
the transplant) and the last one is what needs to be brought back into
the official tree.

Using git diff on each commit, and exporting each of those snippets to
individual files under patches/untangle, is the crude way to do
it. However, using git format-patch <initialCommit..HEAD> is both
easier and more readable, since it will automatically include your
commit messages at the top of each exported patch.

Whatever method you choose, please keep the new patches logically
grouped, and avoid at all costs dropping a big
"untangle_basediff.patch" in patches/untangle: doing this makes it
much harder than it should when we have to port the Untangle patchet
to a different kernel version.
