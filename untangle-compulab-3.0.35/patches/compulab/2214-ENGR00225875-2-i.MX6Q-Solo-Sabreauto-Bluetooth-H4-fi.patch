Subject: ENGR00225875-2 i.MX6Q/Solo Sabreauto Bluetooth H4 fix uart rx
 timeouts.

Bluetooth H4 protocol is very susceptible to data reception timeouts.
DMA transfer only happen when ICD or AGTIM interrutps are trigger.
ICD only happen when a N idle frames are present on rx line
and rx FIFO is empty.
Meanwhile Aging timer is trigger when data in FIFO was been sitting for a
period of 8 frames.
This patch enable both in order to dispatch data as fast is possible only
when the select uart have enable DMA flag.
