+ *
+ * Some revisions of the M29EW (for example, A1 and A2 step revisions)
+ * are affected by a problem that could cause a hang up when an ERASE SUSPEND
+ * command is issued after an ERASE RESUME operation without waiting for a
+ * minimum delay.  The result is that once the ERASE seems to be completed
+ * (no bits are toggling), the contents of the Flash memory block on which
+ * the erase was ongoing could be inconsistent with the expected values
+ * (typically, the array value is stuck to the 0xC0, 0xC4, 0x80, or 0x84
+ * values), causing a consequent failure of the ERASE operation.
+ * The occurrence of this issue could be high, especially when file system
+ * operations on the Flash are intensive.  As a result, it is recommended
+ * that a patch be applied.  Intensive file system operations can cause many
+ * calls to the garbage routine to free Flash space (also by erasing physical
+ * Flash blocks) and as a result, many consecutive SUSPEND and RESUME
+ * commands can occur.  The problem disappears when a delay is inserted after
+ * the RESUME command by using the udelay() function available in Linux.
+ * The DELAY value must be tuned based on the customer's platform.
+ * The maximum value that fixes the problem in all cases is 500us.
+ * But, in our experience, a delay of 30 µs to 50 µs is sufficient
+ * in most cases.
+ * We have chosen 500µs because this latency is acceptable.
