Subject: ENGR00256820-1 ASoC: WM8962: revert FLL-disable before FLL-setting

  The patch at the commit 30293bc6 dropped FLL-disabling code from wm8962
driver, which was a work around for CR 00209905. Since we fixed the issue in
a better way(commit 018958f4), we don't need the work around any more.
  And in wm8962's datasheet, Wolfson suggests that driver should disable and
re-enable the FLL after the other registers're updated. So it's better for us
to revert the code to prevent some potential issue.
