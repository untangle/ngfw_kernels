Subject: ENGR00210360 - EPDC: Fix regulator-related EPDC failure on MX6SL
 ARM2 CPU board

Its similar to ENGR00178581.
Remove call to regulator_has_full_constraints() from Max17135 EPD PMIC
initialization code, since leaving it enabled results in a failure of
system to load properly - key regulators are disabled when 'epdc' is added
to the kernel command line.
