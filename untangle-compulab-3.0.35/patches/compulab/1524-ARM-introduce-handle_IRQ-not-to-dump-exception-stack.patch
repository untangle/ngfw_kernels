When __irq_svc - or any of the other exception handling assembly code -
calls the C code, the stack pointer will be pointing at the pt_regs
structure.

All the entry points into C code from the exception handling code are
marked with __exception or __exception_irq_enter to indicate that they
are one of the functions which has pt_regs above them.

Normally, when you've entered asm_do_IRQ() you will have this stack
layout (higher address towards top):

       pt_regs
       asm_do_IRQ frame

If you insert a C function between the exception assembly code and
asm_do_IRQ, you end up with this stack layout instead:

       pt_regs
       your function frame
       asm_do_IRQ frame

This means when we unwind, we'll get to asm_do_IRQ, and rather than
dumping out the pt_regs, we'll dump out your functions stack frame
instead, because that's what is above the asm_do_IRQ stack frame
rather than the expected pt_regs structure.

The fix is to introduce handle_IRQ() for no exception stack dump, so
it can be called with MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER is selected and a C function
is between the assembly code and the actual IRQ handling code.
