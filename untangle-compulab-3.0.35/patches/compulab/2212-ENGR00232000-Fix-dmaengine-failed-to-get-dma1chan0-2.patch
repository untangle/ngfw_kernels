Subject: ENGR00232000: Fix "dmaengine: failed to get dma1chan0: (-22)" when
 boot

It happens when there are many DMA-engine drivers in the system and
dmaengine_get() is called. dmaengine_get() will call dma_chan_get(), which will
call device_alloc_chan_resources() literally on channels of available dma
drivers unless reach -ENODEV. device_alloc_chan_resources() is implemented
in the individual dma drivers, which could return -EINVAL rather than -ENODEV,
then the above messages print out (doesn't hurt, however).

Indeed, the dmaengine_get() and dmaengine_put() is not needed and thus removed.
