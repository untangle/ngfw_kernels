Subject: ENGR00163275 [MX6]Fix PLL enable fail panic

The root cause is irqs come between PLL register reading
and getting system time, an interrupt handle could take
more than 2ms, which will make the time reading and register
reading unalignment, see below:

1. pll reg read, it is still not locked;
2. here comes an interrupt, and its handler could spent > 2ms;
3. time reading, found current time already > expiration time(1.2ms),
   and we treated the pll lock fail;

There are two method could fix it, one is disable interrupt
during pll lock bit and time expiration check, the other is
to add a second time read after time expiration to make sure
the pll didn't lock during the time we set. I choose the seconde
choise, since it impacts kernel less than disable interrupt;
